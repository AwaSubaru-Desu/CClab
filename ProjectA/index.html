                <p>Living Material</p>

                <h3 class="red">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>Dr Hindenberg, discovered on many places underground on earth at 2044</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>Belongs to the speculative class Synthetic Vitae and the family Geoformic Threads. Their emergence
                    challenges the distinction between biology and architecture. There are still long way ahead of us to
                    learn about them.

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>They thrive in geometrically open spaces with electromagnetic silence. Though invisible underground,
                    their emergence can be triggered by intentional human actions — notably, the placement of attractant
                    markers.
                </p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Long, glimmering filaments that trace elaborate patterns across flat terrains. Their motion resembles
                    growing blueprints. Each individual possesses a chromatic identity, tied to its ancestral “seed” —
                    representing different evolutionary tribes.
                </p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Grows continuously unless encountering a dead zone(created by certain types of chemical matters,
                        in this experiment I dyed them to be red).</li>
                    <li>Communicates via spatial patterns, not sound(in this experiment you can see that they'll follow
                        the guideline which appear as a green ciecle)</li>
                    <li>Mutates color based on origin and environment.</li>
                    <li>Appears to learn from proximity to other lines.</li>

                These living materials are not creature in the traditional sense. It is not cellular, yet it appears
                to adapt, respond, and even “choose” paths. The lines do not just grow — they listen, subtly steering
                toward “suggested” locations when guided by user-generated attractant zones.

                Ancient myths from post-technological societies recall the "Builders Beneath" — entities that shaped
                entire cities under the earth without tools or words. While speculative, some cultural archaeologists
                suggest our line-based organism is a modern reappearance of this long-lost biomechanical ancestry.

                Their exact origin remains unknown. Some theories propose they are a byproduct of urban stress, others
                believe they are memory-encoded geological threads — relics of synthetic design thinking embedded in the
                crust.

                <span class="blue">Left-click to introduce new seeds. Each seed spawns a unique evolutionary tribe.

                    Press A to place attractant zones. Lines will curve toward them, slowly forming patterns.

                    Press D to place red “dead zones.” These zones halt line growth permanently.

                    Right-click to remove zones (attractant or red).

                    Observe their growth — the organism reveals its nature through form, not function.
